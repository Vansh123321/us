    <h2>For My Love ❤️</h2>

    <p>
      Hey my love, my partner, I know today feels heavy and uncomfortable, and I wish I could take all that back and stomach pain away from you. Since I can’t, I want you to know how deeply I love you. tell me how is your health? How were you today? 
    </p>

    <p>
      Yashuu i know i have done nothing for you , you feel i dont care for you but trust me it's not the case.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know i forgot yesterday , which was a special day for us, i know any number of justifications wont help you to forgive me like i just cant even ask you to forgive me.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are my safe place, my favorite thought, and my heart. It's not that i don't consider you, i consider you always, I want you to Close your eyes, breathe slowly, and remember I’m holding you in every heartbeat always.
